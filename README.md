* My First Web development project of a fully-functional, engaging and effective static website which is available for view at [Matata Kahawa Bistro](https://nsm722.github.io/Coffee_Shop_Website/Home.html "Matata Kahawa Bistro")

### Optimization Tools Used For The Project Are:

* HTML5 validation tool [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/ "W3C Markup Validation Service")
* Image assets from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/ "Unsplash - The internetâ€™s source of freely-usable images")
* Font Awesome
* CSS Animations

* WAVE Web accessibility evaluation team tool [Wave web tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
* GTMetrix
* Lazy Loading

**The site menu is editable from googlesheets therefore user-friendly for anyone with no coding experience. Automatic updates are possible due to the use of googlesheetsAPI**
